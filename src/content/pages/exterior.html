            <p class="cs-text">
                We've painted almost every type of house you can find in Vermont. Huge colonials with tricky trim work? Done those. Modern homes with clean lines? Love 'em. Rustic cabins that need some extra TLC? Those are fun too. We're Woodstock painters who take the time to understand what makes your house special.

            <p class="cs-text">
                There's no such thing as a "quick coat." When other house painters rush through prep work, it shows up later. That's why we fix the little stuff, clean everything properly, and make sure your paint job looks great for years, not months.

                You want your paint job to last, right? As Woodstock painters, we learned early on that quality materials matter just as much as good technique. When you spend your days painting Vermont homes, you figure out pretty quick which products actually stand up to our weather.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                We've tested a lot of paints over the years (probably too many, if you ask our wives). But that testing paid off—we know exactly which ones work best for Vermont homes. The right paint means better coverage, fewer coats, and, most importantly, it stays looking fresh way longer.

                Cheap paint costs more in the long run. That's why we only use materials we'd put on our own homes. Better paint means your house looks good longer, stands up to winter better, and doesn't have us back fixing faded spots next season.

                Want to know which products we trust for Vermont homes? Just ask. We love talking about this stuff (maybe too much - but hey, we're paint nerds).
